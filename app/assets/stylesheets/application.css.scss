 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.

//Use import statements instead of Sprockets directives (*=require_tree .), as they will break the build
//ORDERING IS CRUCIAL
@import "global/*";//First, import global variables, mix-in's, and such. MOST IMPORTANT that this precedes everything!

@import "bootstrap";//Next include Twitter bootstrap

@import "partials/*";//Next the partials

@import "*";//Finally include the controller specific styling, miscellaneous gem stlying, and everything else that might be in the current directory
